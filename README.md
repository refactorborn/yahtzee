## yahtzee

Yahtzee is a classic dice game played with 5 dice. Each player's turn consists of rolling the dice up to 3 times in hope of making 1 of 13 categories. Examples of categories are 3 of a kind, 4 of a kind, straight, full house, etc. Each player tries to fill in a score for each category, but this is not always possible. When all players have entered a score or a zero for all 13 categories, the game ends and total scores are compared.

This game of Yahtzee has been made in Java and is meant to be playable inside of the command prompt. At the start of the game you can select an amount of players and the amount of rounds you want to play with a maximum of 13 rounds. Choices can be made in this game by inputting plusses (+) and minusses (-) to select dice and scorefields on the scorecard. After the amount of rounds played as determined from the start the scores will be counted and one or multiple winners will be crowned!
